The Last Fallacy is a simple, top-down, turn-based RPG reminicent of older RPG's.

## Features

What you can expect from The Last Fallacy:

- Simple Turn-based combat system

- A small world which the player can explore

- The setup and start to a narative

## Story

The Last Fallacy starts with the player charater falling into the world below, a world devoid of all colour, and follows his adventures as the chosen one - defeating all sorts of monsters across this fantasy world, the player must reach the devine power that is forcing the once happy world into the now bleak, demon filled land. You are The Last Fallacy sent upon this despair-fallen, strucken world. (This is merely a basis I set when I started development, the release I will be sending at the end of my school project will not be able to convey nearly as much of the base narative that I wish for).
